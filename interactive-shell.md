# Interactive shell

When Rubikâ€™s Futuro Cube is connected to PC, it is possible to communicate with the cube using interactive command shell.

Shell can easily accessed from Rubik's Futuro Cube Suite, but is available for other applications as well, beacuse USB communication on cube provides common **VIRTUAL COM PORT**.

Before accessing the shell from other applications it is recommended to cycle USB to reset communication on character basis. This eventually resets more complex communication scheme   Note that in this case, characters are not automatically sent back to the terminal. Use command `echoon` if needed.
