# 17.85 WaitMelodyOver 

Wait until current melody in progress is over 

Syntax: `WaitMelodyOver()` 

Notes: This function blocks the program until current melody playback is over. It differs from the [previous function](/17-api-native-functions/1785-waitmelodyover.md), because melody playback can be paused, which would appear as the playback is over, in which case the previous function would be used 

Example: `WaitMelodyOver()`
