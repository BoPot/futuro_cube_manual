# Sound resources

There is an easy way to modify or upload your own resources into the Rubik's Futuro Cube and work with them. Standard available sound resources are available [here](http://www.futurocube.com/support/) under **Language packs EN+CZ+GE **section. If you look the offered zipped files, you will find out, that those are regular Microsoft WAV files in following supported formats:

| Highest quality | mono PCM WAV 22.050 kHz 16bit  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Middle quality | mono PCM WAV 22.050 kHz 8bit |  |
| Middle quality | mono PCM WAV 11.025 kHz 16bit |  |
| Lowest quality | mono PCM WAV 11.025 kHz 8bit |  |

If you want, you can for example alternate original resources files and make your own language/crazy distribution. Only try to follow next rules, that applies to all resources, especially for games and apps:

#### Remove DC component from the sample

Playback system in the cubes does not like DC shifted playback. Internal alghoritm counts DC energy of the sound and in case there is chance to damage the speaker, playback is stopped. Lots of free audio editing SWs has built-in filter for DC part removal. 

#### Normalize volume output

Unless you want something specifically loud or silent, always try to normalize the volume to 70-90 % of the maximum output. That way most of the samples will create an comparable feeling. Again this is pretty standard function of the audio editor.
