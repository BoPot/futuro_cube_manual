# Variables

PAWN scripts can access persistent variables where, for example, some game states can be stored for the next run. 

For details about how to use, please refer to [example 5 animated rubiks.p](http://isle.princip.cz/download/futurocube/sdk_examples/example_5_animated_rubiks.p) and to the documentation of APIs related to variables.
