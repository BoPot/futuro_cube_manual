# Uploading resources

Resources can be uploaded only by [Rubik's Futuro Cube Suite](http://www.futurocube.com/support/). The input point is directory or zipped package. In both ways there will be created folder inside the cube, that will be named after the directory or the zipped file. Resources can be added manually or they can be part of the installation package of App/Game. 

You can find detail guides how to use RFCSuite here:
